# aProgram
View more about the aProgram!

aProgram is a program or a game that simulates a command operating system. 
The commands are simple, not complex like DOS, in aProgram you can use a calculator, leave a message on the screen, open limited programs on your computer, and other more functions and interactions. 
aProgram is done entirely in the Python language. 
In fact, aProgram will have its own store, where you can download and install its programs. 
In the future, there will be a community function, where you can create a Python program, and if approved, I will put it on aProgram. 
At the moment I have created few programs, but soon I will create more.
